# The Privacy Law Compass

__The Questions of Interest__ <br/>
Data privacy is one of the most widely discussed issues today, as users leave digital footprints everywhere. It is crucial for governments to safeguard users' information and prevent its misuse. This project aims to explore how data privacy laws vary between state and federal levels. We will also examine how large language models (LLMs) can assist in summarizing legal data, making complex regulations more accessible and easier to understand.

__Project Goal__ <br/>
Our goal is to develop an interactive web tool that visualizes and compares data privacy regulations across different states. This tool will offer users an intuitive way to explore how privacy laws vary by state and evolve over time, providing valuable insights into regulatory trends and developments.
