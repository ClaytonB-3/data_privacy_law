__The Questions of Interest__ <br/>
Data privacy is one of the most widely discussed issues today, as users leave digital footprints everywhere. It is crucial for governments to safeguard users' information and prevent its misuse. 

Our project aims to explore how data privacy laws vary between state and federal levels, and then present it to interested users in a simplified and cogent manner. In this endeavour we will also examine how large language models (LLMs) can be deployed to summarize legal data, and also extract useful information from large documents that contain the bare act's of various governments regarding privacy law. 

__Project Goal__ <br/>
Our goal is to develop an interactive web tool that visualizes and compares data privacy regulations across different states. This tool will offer users an intuitive way to explore how privacy laws vary by state and evolve over time, providing valuable insights into regulatory trends and developments.
